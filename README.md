# Early-944-Radio-Plug

This is a 3-D printable plug I designed to fit the center console of a pre 1985 Porsche 944. 

The model is ready to print and simply drops into place. ASA or PETG or recommended for high-temperature areas, but PLA is satisfactory in cooler climates. Part can be finished with acetone vapor/sanding + plastic primer and paint
